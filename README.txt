Whenever you download a model off the internet, add it to CADLib in case it is needed again in the future. 

When you need something simple of varying lengths, such as metal beams, and there is not a configuration of it, make a new config. 

Name things clearly. 

All parts of the robot that are not a custom sub-assemnbly should be placed in CADLib.
